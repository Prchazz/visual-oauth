- click `register application`

> **leave this tab open to copy over the Client ID and Secret when prompted in the next step**

## Set Up Visual OAuth

### Linux and MacOS

```sh
# run this from the root directory of the repo
$ npm run setup

# you will be prompted for [GitHub Client ID] and [GitHub Client Secret] from when you registered your GitHub oauth app
```

### Windows

```powershell
# run this from the root directory of the repo
> npm run setup:windows

# you will be prompted for [GitHub Client ID] and [GitHub Client Secret] from when you registered your GitHub oauth app
```

## Run Visual OAuth

The client startup script will automatically open your default browser to `http://localhost:3000` after it is done loading.

> NOTE: **it may take up to 30 seconds for the client application to start up**

If your browser doesn't open automatically click this link http://localhost:3000

> you can stop the app using `ctrl+C` in the terminal

### Linux and MacOS

```sh
# run this from the root directory of the repo
$ npm run start
```

### Windows

In Windows **you will need to start both** the API and Client separately in **two different** PowerShell terminals.

In your first PowerShell terminal:

```powershell
# run this from the root directory of the repo
> npm run start:api
```

In your second PowerShell terminal:

```powershell
# run this from the root directory of the repo
> npm run start:client
```

#### WARNING: Windows Browsers

This example will **not work in Microsoft Edge, or Microsoft Internet Explorer**.

If Edge, or IE are your default browser you will need to open a legitimate browser [like Firefox](https://firefox.com) and manually navigate to http://localhost:3000.
